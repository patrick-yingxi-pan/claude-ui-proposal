/** ── Contract: Commission (the agent→Project assignment — D7 / D13) ──────────
 *  The **act** of assigning a worker Agent to a shared Project (docs/agent-commons.md):
 *  the leaf of the D8 attenuation cascade. A Commission carries an optional authority
 *  grant and token sub-budget, each a **subset of the Agent's** (which is itself a
 *  subset of its provider's) — validated once at the creation funnel. An Agent
 *  Commissioned onto a Project plays the **Contributor** role (a role, not a fifth
 *  entity). The Agent's owner pays for its compute (D13: owner-pays), so committing an
 *  Agent to a public Project is donating your own metered compute.
 *
 *  A first-class entity (not a `RelationGraph` edge) precisely so the Project's Guardian
 *  can key its reservation ledger by `commissionId` (D11). */
